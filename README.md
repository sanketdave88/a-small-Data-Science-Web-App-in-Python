# a-small-Data-Science-Web-App-in-Python

## Install prerequisite libraries

In this tutorial, we will be using two Python libraries that require installation. These include streamlit and yfinance. You can easily do this via thepip install command as follows to install streamlit:

```
pip install streamlit
```

And do the same also for yfinance as follows:

```
pip install yfinance
```

## Running the web app

After saving the code into a file called myapp.py, fire up the command prompt (or Power Shell in Microsoft Windows) and run the following command:

```
streamlit run myapp.py
```

**Next, we should see the following message:**

```
> streamlit run myapp.py
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://10.0.0.11:8501
```
